//using System.Diagnostics; // Please use PlanCompiler.Assert instead of Debug.Assert in this class...
// It is fine to use Debug.Assert in cases where you assert an obvious thing that is supposed
// to prevent from simple mistakes during development (e.g. method argument validation 
// in cases where it was you who created the variables or the variables had already been validated or 
// in "else" clauses where due to code changes (e.g. adding a new value to an enum type) the default 
// "else" block is chosen why the new condition should be treated separately). This kind of asserts are 
// (can be) helpful when developing new code to avoid simple mistakes but have no or little value in 
// the shipped product. 
// PlanCompiler.Assert *MUST* be used to verify conditions in the trees. These would be assumptions 
// about how the tree was built etc. - in these cases we probably want to throw an exception (this is
// what PlanCompiler.Assert does when the condition is not met) if either the assumption is not correct 
// or the tree was built/rewritten not the way we thought it was.
// Use your judgment - if you rather remove an assert than ship it use Debug.Assert otherwise use
// PlanCompiler.Assert.

// The PropertyRef class (and its subclasses) represent references to a property
// of a type.
// The PropertyRefList class represents a list of expected properties
// where each property from the type is described as a PropertyRef
//
// These classes are used by the StructuredTypeEliminator module as part of
// eliminating all structured types. The basic idea of this module is that all
// structured types are flattened out into a single level. To avoid a large amount
// of potentially unnecessary information, we try to identify what pieces of information
// are really necessary at each node of the tree. This is where PropertyRef comes in.
// A PropertyRef (and more generally, a PropertyRefList) identifies a list of
// properties, and can be attached to a node/var to indicate that these were the
// only desired properties.
